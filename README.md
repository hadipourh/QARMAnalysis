# Cryptanalysis of QARMAv2

This repository will soon contain the source code of the tools we used in our paper **Cryptanalysis of QARMAv2** (https://ia.cr/2023/1833), accepted to ToSC 2024/1 [(FSE 2024)](https://fse.iacr.org/2024/).

I'm currently in the process of refining the code and creating a brief user manual before officially publishing it. However, if you're eager to use the tool sooner, feel free to reach out to me at [hsn.hadipour@gmail.com](hsn.hadipour@gmail.com).
